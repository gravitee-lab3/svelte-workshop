# Step 2: Understanding components

I started at page https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics, and stopped at page https://svelte.dev/tutorial/spread-props

Ok so now let's dive into svelte, and make our first modifications to the source code.

When learning components, I learned :

* How to declare components and nest them into the main one wichi is importe into the `main.js`
* How to use in those components :
  * page events handlers
  * reactive varaiablesand statements
  * using parameters of components
* I learned that CSS is scoped strictly to the component where it is declared (which is very neat indeed)
